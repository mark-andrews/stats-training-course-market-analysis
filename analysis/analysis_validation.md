* Title: *Re: Bayesian regression modeling in R course*

```
Hi Carlo
Thanks for offering this exciting course! If anyone is looking for a first
course in Bayesian statistics to take prior to Physalia's second course,
head over to Instats <http://instats.com/seminars_courses> where we are
offering an introduction to Bayesian statistics in R and Python by Emma
Zang (Yale University, biostatistics and sociology). Professor Zang has
significant expertise in the area and is teaching two versions of the
seminar, both running Jan 11 - 13: one in English
<https://instats.com/seminar/bayesian-statistics-for-social-and-healt1174>
starting 11am New York time, and another in Mandarin
<https://instats.com/seminar/bayesian-statistics-for-social-and-healt8969>
starting at 8am Beijing time for a Chinese audience. Course information is
as follows:


TITLE:

Bayesian Statistics for Social and Health Scientists in R and Python



SUMMARY:

This seminar will introduce you to the Bayesian way of thinking about
scientific inference and estimation, where *you can make the kinds of
inference that you've been wanting to make all along*: you want to talk
about the probability of your parameters, models, and hypotheses directly!
You will gain insight into what makes Bayesian methods intuitive and
powerful through multiple worked examples in R and Python, including linear
regression and hierarchical regression models. The basic idea behind Bayes'
Theorem will be described, where we will 1) start with an initial
hypothesis about a parameter (called a 'prior probability'), and 2) update
this based on information from an observed dataset (the likelihood), to
derive 3) estimates of the parameter that reflect its probability (called a
'posterior probability'), in order to 4) make inferences about the
parameter for simple and intuitive hypothesis testing.
*By the end of this two-day seminar you will be able to:*

   - Specify a Bayesian model using a likelihood and a prior distribution
   - Update the prior distribution to the posterior distribution upon
   observing the data using Bayes Theorem
   - Estimate a Bayesian linear regression using Gibbs Sampling
   - Analyze Markov chain Monte Carlo samples to understand posterior
   distributions of model parameters and functions of model parameters
   - Generate predictions from MCMC samples
   - Conduct prior and posterior predictive checks
   - Use the Stan probabilistic programming language to specify and
   estimate Bayesian models
   - Specify and estimate Bayesian hierarchical models.


If you have thoughts on Bayesian inference, or questions about how it
works, check out Emma's blog post
<https://instats.com/blogpost/the-clarity-of-bayestmm> on the topic, and of
course feel free to leave a comment! We look forward to seeing you in the
first Bayesian course <http://instats.com/seminars_courses> by Emma Zang
offered through Instats, and then the second course
<https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/bayes-regression/>
offered through Physalia.

Just graduating with a maths/science degree? Unsure what to do next?
Have you considered becoming a medical statistician?

A career in medical statistics gives an opportunity to be involved
in research of direct benefit to people, from public health research
through to drug development. Work is characterised by stimulating 
practical problems and interactions with researchers from other disciplines.
 
The MSc in Medical Statistics at LSHTM has been training medical 
statisticians for more than 40 years and many leading medical statisticians
worldwide are graduates of our MSc. The course is characterised by a 
blend of theory and practical applications - lectures are followed by 
practical sessions - and are taught by subject experts all of whom 
are research active. The LSHTM is an internationally renowned 
postgraduate centre of global health research in the heart of London. 

Graduates from our MSc typically go on to pursue careers in medical
and epidemiological research in academic institutions, hospitals,
the pharmaceutical industry and various public sector institutions. 
Furthermore, there is a world shortage of well qualified medical 
statisticians so job prospects are excellent.
 
A number of scholarships (fees plus a generous tax free living allowance)
are available each year for UK/EU applicants.

Advanced Bayesian Modelling with BUGS

MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK, 18-19 May 2016

This course is designed for statisticians who want to improve their 
command of the BUGS modelling software.  We will assume a previous 
knowledge of BUGS to the level of our companion course "Introduction to 
Bayesian statistics using BUGS".  Through a mixture of lectures and 
practical exercises, participants will learn how the BUGS language can 
be used to build models that represent the complexities of real data.

Topics to be covered include hierarchical modelling, missing data, 
measurement error, censoring and truncation, meta-analysis and general 
evidence synthesis.  Throughout we emphasise thoughtful choices of prior 
distribution, and checking and comparing fitted models.  The WinBUGS, 
OpenBUGS and JAGS software and their R interfaces will all be supported.

Instructors: Dr Christopher Jackson, Dr Robert Goudie & Dr Anne Presanis

**Final call: There are still a few places and a few bursaries available
**

Finite population survey sampling inference - a statistical modelling
approach



June masterclass in social statistics hosted by the Lancaster-Warwick ESRC
National Centre for Research Methods Node

Date: 27th - 28th June 2005


Location: Lancaster University


Presenter: Professor Murray Aitkin, Department of Psychology University of
Melbourne. Australia



This course takes a new approach to inference in sample surveys, and
reconciles the standard finite population survey-sampling approach with
the statistical modelling approach to data analysis. Over a series of four
lectures, concepts such as the empirical likelihood and the likelihood
interval will be introduced. This will then be extended into the Bayesian
context, dealing with such problems as weighting in sample surveys.
Practical demonstrations will be presented to illustrate the techniques.


There is a discount for 2004/5 members of SSM
Further details, including fee structure and timetable, are available from
the website:


<http://www.cas.lancs.ac.uk/masterclasses/finite.html>http://www.cas.lancs.

A registration form is also available on the web:


<http://www.cas.lancs.ac.uk/masterclasses/extregistration.php>http://www.ca
s.lancs.ac.uk/masterclasses/extregistration.php


Professor Murray Aitkin holds the PhD and DSc in mathematical statistics
from Sydney University. He was senior lecturer in statistics in the School
of Behavioural Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney in 1969-76 before
being appointed to Lancaster as SSRC Professorial Fellow in Statistics
Applied to the Social Sciences 1976-79. He was the Foundation Director of
the Centre for Applied Statistics at Lancaster 1979-87, and has since then
held teaching, research and consulting positions at Tel Aviv University,
the Australian National University, the University of Western Australia,
the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, the Educational Testing Service and
the American Institutes for Research. He is now Professorial Fellow in the
Department of Psychology, University of Melbourne.

Introduction to Stata: 8 Oct 2014 or 20 Jan 2015<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/introductory/intro-to-stata/>
- provides an introductory training in STATA, a statistical package increasingly used for social research data analysis which has powerful data manipulation procedures and extensive and powerful statistical capabilities
Logistic Regression: 15th Oct 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/introductory/logistic-regression/> - examines the fitting of models to predict a binary response variable from a mixture of binary and interval explanatory variables. The approach is illustrated using examples from a social science perspective, including cases where logistic regression models are used as a means of analysing tabular data where one of the dimensions of the table is a two-category outcome variable. You will also learn how to fit a logistic regression model, and how to interpret the results.
Basic Maths for Social Statistics: 24th Oct 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/introductory/intro-to-mathematical-concepts/> - covers the following essential topics in mathematics: back to basics (percentages, proportions, averages), data and tables, describing and visualising data, measures of spread, transforming data, concepts in algebra and common symbols, geometry of a straight line, limits and continuity, derivatives and more, maximisation in statistics, correlations, vectors and matrices, solving a multivariate regression problem. There will be exercises and examples of the use of these concepts in mathematics for statistical applications.
Multiple Linear Regression: 14 Oct 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/introductory/multiple-linear-regression/>
- provides a thorough grounding in the theory and methods of multiple linear regression including: model selection, non-linear relationships, dummy variables, interaction terms and assumption testing. The course comprises taught and practical components in about equal proportions. The course is designed for users of survey data with some experience of data analysis and who are comfortable using SPSS and who want to expand their understanding of more sophisticated techniques.
Introduction to R: 14 Nov 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/introductory/intro-to-r/>
-  aimed at people who wish to familiarise themselves with R. It serves as a pre-requisite for the statistical analysis of social networks course, but taken as a one-day course, it is also suitable for anyone interested in using R more generally. R is a command language that can be used to carry out standard statistical analyses but also has powerful facilities to enable users to create their own routines or implement methods designed by other researchers.
Understanding Statistics: 18 Nov 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/introductory/understanding-statistics/>
-  covers understanding of statistics in social policy reports and behind the software packages. It is an opportunity for participants to ask the basic statistical questions they have always wanted to. This course focuses on basic statistical concepts such as: the four levels of measurement, measures of central tendency (median, mean, and mode), measures of dispersion (percentiles, variance, standard deviation, and standard error), confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, design effects and the issue of causality. These skills allow participants to interpret and evaluate existing research findings within the remit of basic statistics. The course is composed of a combination of lectures and practicals.
Introduction to Survey Sampling: 19 Nov 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/introductory/intro-to-survey-sampling/>
- introduces participants to what survey sampling is, why it is important, and how it is implemented. It focuses on the practical aspects as well as some of the technical details. There are four topics covered in the course: Sampling preliminaries and practical considerations (e.g. population and sampling frame); Different types of sampling strategies; Sampling error and sampling size; Design effects. It is suitable for anyone new, or fairly new, to survey research who wishes to conduct their own survey or commission a survey. Participants should have some knowledge of statistics.
Cognitive Interviewing for Testing Survey Questions: 20 Nov 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/introductory/cognitive-interviewing/>
- is designed to familiarise participants with this powerful and efficient method of piloting survey questions called Cognitive Interviewing. Cognitive Interviewing is a type of in-depth interviewing which focuses on respondentsâ thought processing in answering survey questions and uses specialised techniques such as thinking aloud, probing, observation and paraphrasing. The course is about what cognitive interviewing is as well as how to do it. There are practical exercises as well as lecture time.
Introduction to Statistical Testing in Research: 28 Nov 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/introductory/intro-to-statistical-testing-in-research/>
-  aims to cover many of the commonly used parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, along with basic concepts of a randomised clinical trial and the analysis of survival data, with data examples from a health environment but for use in social research more widely.
Latent Factor Analysis: 3 Dec 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/intermediate/latent-factor-analysis/>
- covers latent variables and factor analysis at an introductory and intermediate level. A latent variable is something invisible (such as a concept, an attitude, or an illness) that cannot be measured directly that has been measured using a set of related observed indicators. Factor analysis is one way to derive a single factor from a set of variables, and is thus called a data reduction method. Other data reduction methods include principal components analysis, which is very closely related to factor analysis, and multiple correspondence analysis. We will focus on confirmatory factor analysis, but talk a bit about the differences with exploratory factor analysis. The course is suitable both for primary-data collection researchers (who may need to write a suitable questionnaire), and for those who want to analyse secondary data sets.
An Introduction to Computational Social Science using Big Data: 5 Dec 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/introductory/intro-to-computational-social-science/>
-  every day we interact with countless technological systems, which support our communication, our transport, our shopping activities, and much more. Through these interactions, we are generating increasing volumes of âbig dataâ and there is scope for measuring human behaviour, captured in a natural setting at an unprecedented speed and scale. Such data constitute a new opportunity for social science research. To make maximum use of these datasets, researchers must possess a combination of programming skills and statistical analysis skills, alongside subject specific knowledge. Participants should be interested in learning basic computer programming and statistical analysis skills, and applying these to datasets.
Forecasting Methods and Models: 10 Dec 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/intermediate/forecasting-methods-and-models/>
-  aims to cover the commonly used techniques to forecast demand in public services and in business. The emphasis of this course is on the practical application of forecasting techniques rather than on theoretical content. Alongside quantitative techniques we will also cover the more qualitative and judgement based aspects of forecasting.
Social Media Data Analysis: 11 Dec 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/intermediate/social-media-data-analysis/>
-  designed for those conducting research on the web or for those conducting a non-web research that wish to assess how their topic is reflected in the social web
Statistics for Small Samples: 16 Dec 2014<http://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/courses/short/intermediate/statistics-for-small-samples/>
- covers bivariate statistical tests for a variety of situation. The basic material of t-test is enriched by adding methods for the comparison of the distribution (or a mean) in cases where the variable is not normally distributed. The word âparametricâ is covered so that nonparametric approaches generally can be taken up confidently. The course is at an intermediate level, in the following sense: we hope all participants will read about (or review) the Chi Squared test in preparation. We then move to the small-samples variant of this test, and other tests for varying situations. Time permitting, we also cover the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 2-sample test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, the median test and Spearmanâs coefficients, and one other test statistic. The participants learn to critically assess the validity of claims to statistical inference (from sample to population) in small-N and medium-N situations. Helpful examples are provided in the form of primary survey data from the Young Lives Programme data on care-givers of children born in the year 2000 in four countries, and from a large employment dataset.

Jackie

* Title: *New online short course: Introduction to Quantitative Bias Analysis*

```
*With apologies for cross posting* 

We are delighted to confirm that our new online short course 'Introduction to Quantitative Bias Analysis' is now available to book. 

Introduction to Quantitative Bias Analysis
Live course dates: 3 â 4 June 2025 
Course fee: Â£440 

Outline: 
Data analyses usually make assumptions (which may be explicit or, more commonly, implicit): for example, âno unmeasured confoundingâ. When assumptions are untestable their potential importance can only be addressed through a quantitative bias analysis (also known as a sensitivity analysis). This course will introduce you to quantitative bias analysis methods that have been developed to account for unmeasured sources of bias due to confounding, non-random selection into a study, and measurement error/misclassification.

"Really useful background to all things QBA, with some nice applied examples in R of existing packages" - Course feedback, March 2024

"Really well structured, good overview, good signposting to further resources/reading. Presenters clearly very knowledgeable about the topic" - Course feedback, March 2024

Multivariate Analysis
10 - 11 June

Multivariate Analysis is concerned with methods of analysing data that consists of observations on two or more variables for each individual or unit. Multivariate data will generally be correlated, and a wide variety of techniques are available to analyse these data.
During this course commonly used multivariate techiques will be introduced and developed, and relationships between them examined. Principles will be illustrated using the SAS computer package, the emphasis being on the interpretation of results.

Course content
This is a "mix and match" course of multivariate topics where participants can attend as many half-day modules as they wish. 

  a.. Module 1: Principal components analysis; factor analysis 
  b.. Module 2: Clustering analysis; scaling methods 
  c.. Module 3: Canonical variates analysis; discriminant analysis 
  d.. Module 4: Multivariate hypothesis testing; MANOVA

_____________________________________________________________________________

Repeated Measurements Analysis 
12 - 14 June
In a repeated measurements experiment a sequence of observations is collected for each subject or unit. This raises certain complexities in terms of the analysis of the data. First of all, the comparison of treatments is now in terms of a profile of responses over a period of time, rather than just one single response variable. Secondly the observations are likely to be correlated over time rendering conventional statistical methods inappropriate.

During this course the main types of analysis, from simple methods to complex modelling, are explored and compared. The approach is a practical one and SAS software will be used in lectures and hands-on computer practicals to illustrate the techniques.

Course content 

  a.. Summary statistics 
  b.. Split-plot-in-time ANOVA 
  c.. Repeated measurements MANOVA 
  d.. Ante-dependence analysis 
  e.. Mixed models and REML for repeated measurements; fixed effects models and covariance structures 
  f.. Random regression coefficient models 
  g.. Dealing with categorical data

* Month: May 2021
* Title: *University of Glasgow Course: Maximising the Value of Clinical Trial Data*

```
Dear all,

The Health Economics & Health Technology Assessment (HEHTA) research group at the University of Glasgow is taking bookings for its newest live, online CPD course running in November 2021.

***Maximising the Value of Clinical Trial Data: [Advanced] Analysis for Economic Evaluation and Modelling*** is a natural follow-on from advanced modelling courses and covers the fundamental concepts and practice of the key advanced analytic techniques that are required when determining appropriate approaches and estimating parameter values for cost-effectiveness models. It is also highly relevant to those seeking to improve the relevance of trial-based cost-effectiveness. It will be held using a blend of live online lectures and tutorials.

The course is led by our Professor of Medical Statistics James Lewsey and includes sessions from notable experts including Professor Neil Hawkins & Mr Andrew Davies (University of Glasgow), Dr Suzanne Freeman (University of Leicester) and Professor Andrew Briggs (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine).


The course will cover:

 - Regression analysis to estimate costs and utilities based on trial data, including the use of appropriate techniques for analysing panel data with repeated measures per patient, dealing with differential follow-up, censoring, missing data and skewed data

 - Survival analysis techniques including the use of survival analysis, competing risks analysis, cure models, and multi-state modelling

 - Treatment switching techniques such as rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFMT), inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) and two-stage estimation models.


The course will be run over eight half-day, live online sessions on the following dates:

Week 1: 3rd - 5th November 2021

Week 2: 10th - 12th November 2021

Week 3: 17th & 18th November 2021
