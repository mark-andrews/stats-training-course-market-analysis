Below is a categorization of statistics or data analysis or data science topics in 13 major categories (from *Category 1: Core statistical methods* to *Category 13: Meta-Research & Evidence Synthesis* ).
For some of these category, there are sub-categories of sub-topics.
For all categories or sub-categories, there are large numbers of different keywords.
These keywords are non-exhaustive, but are highly indicative of what the content of the category or sub-category is.

Then I am going to give you a word or a phrase that is a keyword topic or description of some methods training course mostly in social and economic science.
For each of these words or phrases, I would like you to tell me which one of the categories and/or sub-categories best match that word or phrase.

If none of the categories or sub-categories below meaningfully relate to the word or phrase, just say "None".

It may be that the word or phrase equally relates to more than one of the categories or sub-categories below. In that case, you may return more than one answer.

Please provide a brief explanation for your choices.

You should answer as follows:

category: <category/sub-category>; <another category/sub-category>
explanation: <the explanation of your choice>
