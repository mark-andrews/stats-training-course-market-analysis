Below is a list of 150+ statistical / data-science topics.

I am going to give you a word or a phrase that is somehow related to statistics or data-science.

I would like you to tell me which one of the 150+ statistical / data-science topics best describe or best match the meaning of that word or phrase.

If none of the topics below meaningfully relate to the word or phrase, just say "None".

It may be that the word or phrase equally relates to more than one of the topics below. In that case, you may return more than one topic.

Please provide a brief explanation for your choices.

You should answer as follows:

topic: <topic in list>; <another topic in list>; <yet another topic>
explanation: <your explanation of your choice>
